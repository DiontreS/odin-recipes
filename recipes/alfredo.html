        <h1>Alfredo</h1><br>
        <img src="../images/alfredo p.jpg" alt="Pasta!" style="width:150px"><br>
        <h4>Description</h4><br>
        <p>This creamy, garlicky, smooth Alfredo sauce is the absolute best. <br>
            You do not want to use a grated Parmesan that you buy on a shelf. <br>
            When you cook with that type, your Alfredo goes from a sauce to a gooey mess. <br>
            You want to buy a very good and very hard Parmesan cheese in triangle form. <br>
            Also, make sure the cream doesn't boil too much or there will not be enough liquid<br>
             to make the Alfredo sauce smooth.</p><br>
         <h5>Ingredients</h5><br>
         <ul>
            <li>10 ounces of fettucine</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
            <li>5 cloves of chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 cups of freshly grated parm</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of dried parsley</li>
         </ul>
         <h5>Directions</h5>
         <ol>
            <li>Step 1 <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and <br>
                bring to a rolling boil over high heat.</p></li>
            <li>Step 2 <p>Coarsely chop the tomato and transfer to a small bowl.<br>
                 Sprinkle the tomato chunks with basil, olive oil, and salt. Set aside.</p></li>
            <li>Step 3 <p>Once the water is boiling, stir in the rigatoni, and return to a boil.<br>
                 Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through,<br>
                  but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander, and then return<br>
                   the pasta to the pot.</p></li>
            <li>Step 4 <p>Pour the tomato mixture over the pasta and toss to mix.</p></li>
         </ol>
