        <h1>Alfredo</h1><br>
        <img src="../images/alfredo p.jpg" alt="Pasta!" style="width:150px"><br>
        <h4>Description</h4><br>
        <p>This creamy, garlicky, smooth Alfredo sauce is the absolute best. <br>
            You do not want to use a grated Parmesan that you buy on a shelf. <br>
            When you cook with that type, your Alfredo goes from a sauce to a gooey mess. <br>
            You want to buy a very good and very hard Parmesan cheese in triangle form. <br>
            Also, make sure the cream doesn't boil too much or there will not be enough liquid<br>
             to make the Alfredo sauce smooth.</p><br>
         <h5>Ingredients</h5><br>
         <ul>
            <li>10 ounces of fettucine</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
            <li>5 cloves of chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 cups of freshly grated parm</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of dried parsley</li>
         </ul>
         <h5>Directions</h5>
         <ol>
            <li>Step 1 <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br>
                 Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</p></li>
            <li>Step 2 <p>Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter and add chopped garlic.<br>
                 Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent garlic from burning.</p></li>
            <li>Step 3 <p>Pour about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream into a small bowl. Add egg yolk and beat <br>
                together; set aside.</p></li>
            <li>Step 4 <p>Pour remaining cream into the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high. As cream <br>
                starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Add egg mixture slowly to prevent curdling, whisking<br>
                 until well blended. Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese until combined.</p></li>
            <li>Step 5 <p>Add remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley; mix until smooth. Remove from heat <br>
                and serve over cooked pasta.</p></li>
