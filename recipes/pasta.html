        <h4>Description</h4><br>
        <p>This is an extremely simple pasta recipe that I love to make when I don't really feel like cooking! <br>
        I use rigatoni, but you can use whatever pasta you prefer. This is especially delicious with tomatoes fresh<br>
         from your garden. Serve with garlic bread and a simple lettuce salad with Italian dressing.</p><br>
         <h5>Ingredients</h5><br>
         <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package of dry pasta</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>1 medium tomato</li>
            <li>1 tspn dried basil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
         </ul>
         <h5>Directions</h5>
         <ol>
            <li>Step 1 <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and <br>
                bring to a rolling boil over high heat.</p></li>
            <li>Step 2 <p>Coarsely chop the tomato and transfer to a small bowl.<br>
                 Sprinkle the tomato chunks with basil, olive oil, and salt. Set aside.</p></li>
            <li>Step 3 <p>Once the water is boiling, stir in the rigatoni, and return to a boil.<br>
                 Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through,<br>
                  but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander, and then return<br>
                   the pasta to the pot.</p></li>
            <li>Step 4 <p>Pour the tomato mixture over the pasta and toss to mix.</p></li>
         </ol>
