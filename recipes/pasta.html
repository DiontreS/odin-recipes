        <h4>Description</h4><br>
        <p>This is an extremely simple pasta recipe that I love to make when I don't really feel like cooking! <br>
        I use rigatoni, but you can use whatever pasta you prefer. This is especially delicious with tomatoes fresh<br>
         from your garden. Serve with garlic bread and a simple lettuce salad with Italian dressing.</p><br>
